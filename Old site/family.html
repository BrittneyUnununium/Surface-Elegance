<center><h1>Hello!</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the Bare - Schaefer - Kocik Family!</h2></center>

<p><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><strong>I am part of a large extended family.</p>

<p>On this side we count ourselves starting with my mother, Betty Ann Bare.  My father, Bob Bare, passed away in 1995.  Since then, my mother met John Zajic.  </p>

<p>We have plenty of family names like Bare, Phillips, Kocik, Schaefer, Bannerman, Lorente, Roberson, Wagman, just to name a few.  A real genealogical primordial soup!</p>

<p>Although there are plenty of ancestors with children that number in the teens, I'm going to focus on our immediate clan.  When I get some time, I will do a proper genealogical tree.

<p>Starting with my mom and dad (the Bare Clan), there's my brother Robert and myself, along with all our various children!</p>

		<h3>Robert's Clan</h3>
		<ul>
                        <li>Robert and his wife Maria (Lorente)
                        <li>Robert and Maria's son Robert James III
                        <li>Robert's son Ricardo Bare and his wife Angie</li>
                        <li>     Their children Sophia and Soren</li>
                        <li>Robert's Daughter Christina (Bare) Roberson and her husband Charlie</li>
			<li>      Their children Matt and Katie</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Karen's Clan</h3>
		<ul>
                        <li>Karen and her husband Dennis Kocik
                        <li>Karen's son Brandon Bannerman and Jess Wagman, his partner</li>
                        <li>     Their children Wesley and "Tadlet"</li>
                        <li>Karen's son Chris Schaefer, who just joined the army!</li>
			<li>Karen's daughter Trisha Schaefer</li>

<p>Our family loves to take vacations together.  There are usually about 18 of us from babies to seniors.  Our favorite camp out is Duck, North Carolina.  I think this year we won't get together, for the economy as well as people moving and changing jobs.  It's been a really good year for use all in all so perhaps we do it for another holiday!</p>

<p>My brother and I grew up overseas mostly although we had a few stints in the US from time to time.  We lived in Panama, where he was born, Japan, Philippines, spent some time in Guam, Hong Kong, Hawaii and almost got to go to Argentina I believe!</p>

<p>Our parents met in Lakehurst, New Jersey.  My dad was in the Navy, studying to be a meteorologist and my mom lived in Toms River.  My dad and his family had lived in Arkansas all their lives up till then.
