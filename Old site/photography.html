<h1>Favorite Photo Shots</h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3>These are some of my favorite shots I have taken over the years.  Some were taken with my Olympus Digital Zoom and more recent photos (2009) have been taken with my new Nikon D-40 Digital SLR.</h3>
<p>This fountain was at the Henry the Navigator School of Navigation in Sagres, Portugal.</p>

<p>This picture, well you'd have to see what I cropped it from - it's at the end of this set.  </p>

<p>A little bit more zoomed out from the first shot. </p>

<p>A broader zoom showing that it's a tip of a branch in a creek that had frozen over after bowing into the water from the weight of the ice.</p>

<p>Later in the winter I went back after the snow had melted to get a picture of the area just to note to myself how a moment can make a difference in what you see in the world.  See if you can tell what had to happen to make the ice sculpture.  Some of the elements had to move.</p>

<p>This lovely fella has been gracing my garden for years and has left behind many of his kin.</p>

<p>We were traveling home from North Carolina and spotted this barn just after a rainfall.</p>

<p>The following two pictures I took of the same field, once in the spring, once during the winter and on opposite sides of the fence. </p>

<p>During the fall found a stump with some interesting textures and loved the way the layers of leaves in the background interacted with that stump.</p>
