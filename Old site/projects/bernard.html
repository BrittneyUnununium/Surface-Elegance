<center><h1>Bernard Project</h1>
<h2>Completed July 2009</h2>
<h3></h3></center>
<center><p>Hi Mommy!!  We're having fun!! But, uh, ok, we miss you - yep got food and water and staying dry, but we still miss you!!  We're getting some play time in now that the rooms are back to the way they were before, and we like hanging out with the painter gals.  We said our tails would work well - you know, like dipping them in the paint and doing some texture on the walls - heck, no one but us thought that was a good idea - so pretty much we're just supervising.  We try to check out the progress from a lot of angles.  Ah, and um, one us really likes Karen's shoes.  We won't say who......<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><blockquote></p>

<p>They've all been scraped and repainted a soft eggshell - this is the green bedroom ceiling.</p>

<p>The first floor closet has been painted inside and out.  All the closets were painted in Betsy's Linen semi-gloss.</p>

<p>The living room crown was caulked, primed and painted.  Some of the other areas were caulked and touched up as well.</p>

<p>The new basement colors.  The ceiling is in Navajo White eggshell.  The accent wall is Springfield Tan and all the other walls are Yosemite Sand, all in eggshell.  It's now a warm and inviting room.</p>
<p>The room hasn't been reassembled yet in this picture.</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockqoute></blockquote>
