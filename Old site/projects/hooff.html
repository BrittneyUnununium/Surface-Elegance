<h2>Dining Room, Completed September 2006</h2>
<h3>Here's the thing - if stripes look like they are easy, you know, just lines on a wall, think again!   When you have to make things look even throughout a room, starting from one wall and going around the room, you'll find out why you needed to learn math in school!!  
<p>This dining room has exposure on all four sides to another area.  There is a grand opening between the dining and living rooms, two windows on the outside wall of the house, french doors on the third wall to the patio, and a door into the kitchen off to the side on the fourth wall.  Not to mention that the room isn't really square in the corners.  </p>
<p>This particular project was an extreme mathematical challenge.  I took me several days and many tries marking the walls with pencil and tape to get the stripes to match in alternating colors from one wall to the next.  On each wall, I'd start over the doorways or windows.  I made a lot of my adjustments in the corners as I found the stripes could be the largest there.  I imagined it was like a triangle, the point being in the corner and the base facing out.  The base was what you'd "see" as the width of the stripe, not the sum of each side of the triangle on the wall.  
<p>If you were to measure these stripes you will find that some are 4" some are up to 6" and so on.   The eye is fooled into thinking they are the same depending on their placement.  I also worked hard to make them symmetrical around the openings.  For example, in the first picture, you'll see that I centered the dark stripe over the doorway and move outward with the stripes.  I was able to do this around the doorway into the kitchen.  However, over the opening to the living room and around the windows, the center point is where two stripes meet.</p></h3></center>

<p>These two pictures are of the vestibule for the front door.  Painted a nice strip from one side of the wall to the other including the ceiling.</p>
