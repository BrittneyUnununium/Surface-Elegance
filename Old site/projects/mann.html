<center><h1>Mann Master Bath Project</h1>
<h2>Completed March 2008</h2>
<h3></h3></center>

<p><strong>Robyn's Master Bath Remodel</strong></p>
		<p>In this bathroom make over we added wainscoting, individual 4" boards, with new base, shoe and cap.  We framed in the mirror, primed and painted the wood cabinets including scoring the doors to match the lines in the wainscoting, and added crown molding to the ceiling.  The top of the vanity and Jacuzzi areas were resurfaced with a product called SpreadStone and all new faucets, handles, and lighting were added.  Lots of details in the trim work as well!!  The spreadstone was sculpted and colored to match the look and tone of the existing flooring.  The walls were painted a soft green that matched the color in the adjoining bedroom.  I had a glitch with my camera and so there are no before pictures but the existing walls were wallpapered from the 80's which the client painstakingly removed herself!</p>
