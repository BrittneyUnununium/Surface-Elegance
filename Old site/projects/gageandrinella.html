<center><h1>Gage & Rilella Project</h1>
<h2>Completed April 2009</h2>
<h3>Sylvia Gage and Lorraine Rinella of Gage and Rinella and I have worked together for years on some very interesting projects.  This office reception space originally was scheduled to have vertical stripes.  However, once I looked at the space it seemed more to want a horizontal treatment.  The wall was a beautiful curve behind the reception desk.  This is the left section of the wall - imagine that wall continuing the curve to the right.</h3></center>

<p>I won't bore you with the mathematical calculations, but I did divide the sections based on the surrounding architectural elements.  One of the elements I mimicked was the chair rail which is the first light grey stripe above the darker grey.  You can get a peek of the actual chair rail on the left in the picture below.</p>
