<p>Check out the VOLUNTEER tab for before and after pictures of my recent trip to Pearlington, Mississippi.  With four of us from here in Charlottesville via the Building Goodness Foundation, a family of four from Vancouver, Canada who also volunteered through BGF, and twenty-something high schoolers from St. Louis who were staying at the Pearlington Recovery Center, we were able to complete TWO COATS of exterior painting on the Pearlington Community Center in three days.  The interior is six thousand square feet and two stories high in some places, so, yeah, we ROCKED!!!</p>
<p>Here's our team below on left, standing in back from left to right, Alexander Milani, David McFayden, Charlie Strickland, Jack Schatzman and Tim Duke.  In front, Katrina Milani, Nicole Milani, and myself.

<p><strong>Murphy Window Seat</strong></p>
<p>Hey, I'm not a cabinet maker by trade but I do build dollhouses and construct other kinds of wood projects at home, so when I was offered the chance to build this window seat, I already saw the completed unit in my mind.</p>
<p>This project was actually completed in April.  It's not the most recent but one that was a lot of fun to do.</p>
<p>Here is the way the space looked before.  The clients had a nice table they used for the family off to the right of the picture.  Besides extra storage and a place to sit and read, the window seat also served as bench seating when a large group was eating.</p><img class="photo" src="projects/images/othersurfaces/murphybefore.jpg" height="350" width="550" alt="" />
<p>After measuring the middle window area, I constructed the center box at home first, including the lid and the center baffle for redirecting the air from the floor vent.  On site, I constructed the side triangular sections, installed the baseboard, picture frame molding, new shoe molding, decorative trim on the lid egdes, and new white vent.  The picture below shows the cabinet still needing some sanding, painting and caulking.</p><img class="photo" src="projects/images/othersurfaces/murphystage02.jpg" height="350" width="550" alt="" />
<p>All three sections open for storage.  Another mathematical and spatial challenge.  If I had software for designing things, I could have had a blueprint for all the angles, however, there were some things that only could have been adjusted by trial and error with the pieces.  I made the triangles larger and by moving the center piece and those two around, I was able to get a nice fit.  I then cut the fronts of the triangles to be even with the center top and then add the decorative trim.</p><img class="photo" src="projects/images/othersurfaces/murphystage03.jpg" height="350" width="550" alt="" />
<p>This is the center baffle that I built.  It has a set of chambers that move the air up and out the front.  It worked like a charm.  I was looking for some HVAC element and it may be out there somewhere but nothing that would just hook into a floor vent and curve out to another vent in the front.  I found one thing in metal that I could have modified but that was more work than simply constructing this box.</p><img class="photo" src="projects/images/othersurfaces/murphystage04.jpg" height="350" width="550" alt="" />
<p>The triangle lids were also a challenge.  I had to bevel the back edges so that they would close without rubbing the center lid.  Also had to cut the hinge at the back area at an angle so that it would fit in the back area properly.</p><img class="photo" src="projects/images/othersurfaces/murphystage05.jpg" height="350" width="550" alt="" />
<p>Finally a finished window seat.  The cushions are being custom made to fit the seat.  The Murphys were very pleased!</p><img class="photo" src="projects/images/othersurfaces/murphyafter.jpg" height="350" width="550" alt="" /></div>
