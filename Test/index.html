					Check out the <a href="volunteer.html" target="_blank">volunteer</a> section for before and after photos of my recent trip to Pearlington, Mississippi. With four of us from here in Charlottesville via the Building Goodness Foundation, a family of four from Vancouver, Canada who also volunteered through BGF, and twenty-something high schoolers from St. Louis who were staying at the Pearlington Recovery Center, we were able to complete TWO COATS of exterior painting on the Pearlington Community Center in three days. The interior is six thousand square feet and two stories high in some places, so, yeah, we ROCKED!!!<br />
