Going through the pages now.  On the "family" page, replace the text with this 
"I am part of a large extended family. My immediately family started with my parents, Betty Ann & Bob Bare.  I was born first in 1953 and then my brother followed in 1955.  My father passed away in 1995 and my brother in 2016.  My brother had three children and between the oldest two I have seven great nieces and nephews!  I had three children myself and have one grandson and one granddaughter.  I also have three stepsons three grandchildren on my husband Dennis' side. "

Under "Robert's Clan" modify the one sentence, you'll know which one:
"Their children Sophia, Soren, Halo, Layla & Michael"

Under me, just replace it with this:
"Karen and her husband Dennis Kocik
Karen's son Brandon Bannerman & partner Brittney 
His son Wesley and stepson Logan
Karen's son Chris Schaefer and his daughter Savannah
Karen's daughter Trisha Schaefer and parther Scott 
Dennis' son Daniel Kocik and partner Sarah
Dennis' son Denny Kocik
Dennis' son Devin Kocik and wife Becky
Their kids Christopher, Kaitlyn, and Eric

Eliminate this sentence "I think this year we won't get together, for the economy as well as people moving and changing jobs. It's been a really good year for use all in all so perhaps we do it for another holiday!"

I'll work out the picture replacements this weekend.
